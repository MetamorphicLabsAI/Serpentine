# Serpentine 🐍

A highly stylized, neon outrun/cyberpunk-themed Snake Game.

## Overview
Serpentine is a modern re-imagining of the classic arcade game built strictly with Vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS. It requires no frameworks, plugins, or package managers. 

## Features 🚀
* 🎵 **Procedural Synthwave Synth**: A complete 38.4-second looping background track composed mathematically using the browser's native Web Audio API. Zero external MP3 downloads required! Includes driving basslines, arpeggiated synth melodies, kicks, and snares.
* ✨ **Particle Physics Collision Engine**: Eating food or dying erupts into dynamic, fading retro-neon particle explosions rendered beautifully at 60fps using `requestAnimationFrame`.
* 🕹️ **Arcade Mechanics**: Multi-directional logic built for keyboard (WASD/Arrows) and touch screens (fluid swipe gestures on mobile devices).
* 💾 **Persistent Memory**: Uses browser `localStorage` to permanently save your highest game score on your machine.
* 🎨 **Hardware Accelerated UI**: Built with scanline CSS overlays, breathing glow elements, game-over screen shake mechanics, and dynamic arcade cabinet color grading that shifts to match your selected snake profile.
* ⚙️ **Arcade OS Menu System**: A fully integrated main menu UI allowing seamless navigation between game modes, difficulty parameters, and character profiles.
* 🐍 **Selectable Snake Profiles**: Choose between different retro-cyberpunk characters like Glitch-Wave, Void Walker, or Mecha-Serpent with unique lore and custom, fully color-matched neon aesthetics.
* 🔓 **Unlockable Mechanics**: Complete in-game milestones to permanently unlock exclusive profiles (like the shifting *Chromatic Punch* algorithm). Locked characters are shrouded in mystery as solid grey HUD silhouettes with '???' naming and yellow tactical unlock criteria displayed natively in their lore panels! Satisfying an unlock condition triggers a triumphant global synthesized audio chord alongside a full-spectrum particle eruption mid-gameplay.
* 🔥 **Dynamic Difficulty Modes**: Scale your challenge precisely across Easy (180ms tick rate), Medium (120ms tick rate), Hard (80ms tick rate), and Insane (50ms tick rate) speeds.
